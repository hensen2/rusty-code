## Features

- **Generic Implementation**: All data structures work with various data types
- **Domain-Specific Optimizations**: Specialized variants for bioinformatics and finance
- **Concurrent Access**: Thread-safe implementations where appropriate
- **Serialization Support**: Persistence and interoperability with other systems

## Getting Started

### Installation

Add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
rusty-code = "0.1.0"
```

For domain-specific functionality:

```toml
[dependencies]
rusty-code = { version = "0.1.0", features = ["bio", "finance"] }
```

### Basic Usage

```rust
use rusty-code::structures::trees::BTree;

fn main() {
    let mut tree = BTree::<i32>::new();
    tree.insert(42);
    assert!(tree.contains(&42));
}
```

## Technology Stack

- **Rust 2021 Edition**: For memory safety and performance
- **Serde**: For serialization/deserialization
- **Rayon**: For parallel processing
- **Domain-specific crates**: For specialized functionality
